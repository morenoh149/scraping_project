They also introduce to me about what they do in the data science team. The second round is a coding interview. The interviewer ask me to write a specific class using python. I was not very familiar with the top programming, and the interviewer gave me an detail example and a lot of hints to guide me finish the process. The two rounds onsite interview and the interviewers are all very nice."},
